# AppDev-Calculator
This is a calculator app I am implementing to learn about app development.

Q. What can it do currently?
A. It can perform the four basic operations for two numbers(including signed and unsigned floating point numbers). It handles empty strings in the input as well as dividing by zero.

Q. What implementations I plan to add?
A. Firstly, I would like to add functionalities to it such that multiple operations can be performed in a row, without using the "equal to" button (ie, 2 + 4 + 6 should be calculated at the same time). Then, I would like to implement PEMDAS, and finally, I would like to convert into a scientific calculator.
