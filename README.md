This is a calculator app I am implementing to learn about app development.

Q. What can it do currently? 
A. It can perform the four basic operations for multiple numbers(including signed and unsigned floating point numbers) in a row (not considering priority). It handles empty strings in the input as well as dividing by zero.

Q. What implementations I plan to add? 
A. Firstly, I would like to implement PEMDAS, and then, I would like to convert into a scientific calculator.
