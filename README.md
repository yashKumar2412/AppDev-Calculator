# AppDev-Calculator
This is a calculator app I am implementing to learn about app development.

Q. What can it do currently?
A. It can perform the four basic operations for two unsigned numbers(including floating point numbers). It ensures that an empty string isn't entered, as well as the denominator during division is not zero.

Q. What implementations I plan to add?
A. Firstly, I would like to implement this for signed numbers as well. Then, I would like to add functionalities to it such that multiple operations can be performed in a row, without using the "equal to" button (ie, 2 + 4 + 6 should be calculated at the same time). Then, I would like to implement PEMDAS, and finally, I would like to convert into a scientific calculator.
